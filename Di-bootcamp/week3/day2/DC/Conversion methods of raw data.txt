1) A series of blog posts about travel experiences

Method (summary): scrape/ingest the posts → extract metadata + clean text → run NLP to pull entities, topics, sentiment, locations → normalize/geo-code → store records.
Steps

Ingest: fetch HTML (or use RSS/API) and save raw HTML + post ID.

Parse & normalize: extract title, author, publish date, tags, images, main body (use boilerplate removal).

NLP extraction: run language detection, tokenization, named-entity recognition (places, hotels, attractions), keyphrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and topic classification.

Geo-normalize: convert place names to standardized location fields (city, country, lat/lon) with a geocoder.

Store: one row per post in a table, plus linked tables for mentions (places), images, and tags.
Example schema (one table):
Post_ID | Title | Author | Publish_Date | Language | Summary | Sentiment | Primary_Location | Lat | Lon | Main_Topics | Keywords | Word_Count | URL
Tools/techniques: HTML parsers (requests + BeautifulSoup / newspaper libraries), spaCy/NLP models, geocoding API, deduplication.
Reasoning: blog posts are semi-structured (metadata + long text). Extracting metadata + entities turns free text into searchable, filterable columns (e.g., all posts about “Lisbon” or posts with negative sentiment). This enables analytics (popular locations, average sentiment by destination, cost comparisons).
Quality notes: handle multilingual posts, remove boilerplate, keep raw text for audits, and use human review for uncertain geocoding or topic labels.

2) Audio recordings of customer service calls

Method (summary): perform speaker diarization + high-quality ASR → enrich transcripts with timestamps, intent & sentiment analysis, and call metrics → redact PII → store structured call-level and segment-level records.
Steps

Ingest: store raw audio and minimal metadata (call_id, timestamp, agent_id).

Preprocess: noise reduction, channel separation.

Diarization: label speaker segments (agent vs customer).

ASR (speech-to-text): produce time-aligned transcripts.

NLP on transcript: detect intents (billing, cancellation, support), extract entities (product names, order numbers), measure sentiment/emotion per segment, and flag regulatory/compliance phrases.

Compute KPIs: call duration, silence/hold time, interruption rate, resolution flag.

PII redaction & compliance: detect and redact credit card numbers, SSNs, and other sensitive data before storing/transferring.

Store: call-level table + segment-level table (timestamps, speaker, transcript segment, sentiment, intents).
Example schema (call-level):
Call_ID | Agent_ID | Customer_ID | Start_Time | Duration | ASR_Confidence | Main_Intents | Overall_Sentiment | Outcome | Redaction_Flag | Transcript_Link
Reasoning: transcripts + diarization convert audio into searchable text and actionable metrics. Segmenting by speaker plus intent detection makes it possible to monitor agent performance, automate routing, and spot compliance issues.
Tools/techniques: ASR engines (Whisper/Cloud STT), diarization toolkits, NLP intent classifiers, regex for PII, human-in-loop review for low-confidence parts.
Privacy & legal: obtain consent, encrypt stored audio/transcripts, apply retention policies, and ensure redaction before using data for analytics.

3) Handwritten notes from a brainstorming session

Method (summary): digitize with high-res imaging → handwriting OCR or human transcription → structure into discrete “ideas” with metadata (author, confidence, tags, relationships) → optionally convert to mind-map nodes.
Steps

Capture: scan or photograph pages with good lighting; store raw images.

Preprocess: image enhancement (deskew, contrast).

Handwriting recognition: attempt automated HTR (handwritten text recognition) or use human transcribers for messy handwriting. Use layout analysis to detect columns/boxes/bullets.

Segmentation & parsing: split into notes/lines/actions; detect checkboxes/arrows/priority marks.

NLP & tagging: run keyword extraction, cluster similar ideas, label action items and owners (if annotated).

Store: one row per note/idea with links to page/image and spatial coordinates. Also store relationships (idea A -> idea B) if arrows were present.
Example schema (idea-level):
Idea_ID | Page_ID | Text | Author (if known) | Confidence_Score | Is_Action_Item | Priority | Tags | X,Y_bbox | Image_Link
Reasoning: brainstorming notes are spatial and often free-form; converting them into discrete, tagged ideas makes them discoverable, searchable, and trackable as tasks. Preserving coordinates and original image helps audit context (e.g., an arrow connecting two notes).
Tools/techniques: OCR/HTR engines (for printed vs cursive), computer vision for layout detection, human verification for low-confidence outputs, tools to export to Trello/Jira or mind-map formats.
Practical tip: expect variable accuracy—plan for a light human review step and capture metadata like the session facilitator and date.

4) A video tutorial on cooking

Method (summary): extract audio → ASR → timestamped transcript → video analysis (shot detection, OCR on on-screen text, object/ingredient/tool detection) → align recipe steps with timestamps and images → store structured recipe and step-by-step dataset.
Steps

Ingest: keep raw video file and basic metadata (uploader, title, duration).

Audio → ASR: get time-aligned transcript (captions).

Vision analysis: run shot/scene detection to find step boundaries; use object detection on frames to identify ingredients, utensils, and cooking actions (e.g., chopping, frying). Use OCR to capture any on-screen measurements or timers.

Align & extract recipe structure: identify ingredients list (with quantities if spoken/onscreen), steps with start/end timestamps, estimated times, servings, tips, and difficulty. Capture representative thumbnail for each step.

Enrich: classify cuisine, diet tags (vegan, gluten-free), estimated prep/cook times, and create a searchable ingredient index.

Store: recipe table + steps table (with timestamps, action verbs, ingredient links) + detected objects table.
Example schemas:
Recipe: Recipe_ID | Title | Uploader | Servings | Prep_Time | Cook_Time | Cuisine | Difficulty | URL
Step: Step_ID | Recipe_ID | Step_Order | Start_TS | End_TS | Instruction_Text | Ingredients_Used | Tool_List | Thumbnail_Link
Reasoning: cooking videos contain both audio instructions and visual demonstrations; combining ASR with visual detection yields a structured, time-aligned recipe that can power step-by-step viewers, ingredient search, or conversion into text recipes. Timestamps let you jump to exact moments.
Tools/techniques: ASR, shot-detection, object detection (ingredients/tools), OCR for on-screen text, pose/action recognition for complex gestures. Human review improves extraction of quantities and ambiguous ingredient names.
Quality note: spoken quantities may be ambiguous (“a cup” vs “one cup”) — validation or human correction helps produce usable recipe data.

Cross-cutting best practices (applies to all)

Keep raw files alongside extracted structured records for traceability.

Assign unique IDs & versioning so you can reprocess with improved models later.

Human-in-the-loop for low-confidence items (handwriting, noisy audio, ambiguous visual detections).

Audit & quality metrics (ASR confidence, OCR confidence, entity match rates) stored as columns to drive sampling for review.

Privacy & compliance: redact PII, get consent for recordings, and encrypt sensitive fields.

Storage choices: small-scale → relational DB (Postgres) or CSV; search & analytics → document store / Elasticsearch + data warehouse for aggregated metrics.
